    " 2. Red Dots Increase with Higher Income\n",
    " • In the higher-income range (above ~$100K), there are more red dots visible.\n",
    " • This suggests that people with higher income are more likely to take personal loans.\n",
    " 3. Lower Income → Fewer Personal Loans\n",
    " • In the lower part of the income range (under ~$50K), most dots are blue, indicating low loan approval or request in this group.\n",

    " 2. Loan Takers Increase with Mortgage\n",
    " • As mortgage values increase, the proportion of red points increases (especially in the 100–300 range).\n",
    " • Suggests that people who already have mortgages are more likely to also take personal loans — possibly due to higher financial responsibilities or access to more credit.\n",
    " 3. Experience Doesn’t Provide Clear Separation\n",
    " • Similar to the previous plot, experience is spread across the board without a strong pattern.\n",

    " 2. Loan Takers Tend to Have Higher CCAvg\n",
    " • Red points are more visible as CCAvg increases.\n",
    " • This suggests that those who use credit cards more actively (possibly indicating comfort with debt or higher purchasing power) are more likely to also take out loans.\n",
    " 3. Experience Doesn’t Show Strong Separation Alone\n",
    " • Across all experience levels, both red and blue dots appear.\n",
    " • So experience alone doesn’t clearly distinguish between loan takers and non-takers — it’s not a strong standalone predictor in this plot.\n",
    " 4. Outliers in CCAvg\n",
    " • Some red points at very high CCAvg values (~6+) are evident — likely high spenders and more confident borrowers.\n",
    " • These might be strong candidates for targeted marketing or credit offers.\n",
    "\n",

    " 2. Loan Takers Cluster with Higher Income and Mortgage\n",
    " • As we move right and up (higher income & higher mortgage), the red points become denser.\n",
    " • That means people with higher income and existing mortgages are more likely to take personal loans.\n",
    " 3. No Personal Loan at High Income Without Mortgage\n",
    " • Interestingly, at high income but mortgage = 0, there are very few or no red dots.\n",
    " • Possibly because those people don’t need personal loans — they have income but no mortgage obligations.\n",
    " 4. Strong Interaction Between Income and Mortgage\n",

    " 3. Dense Blue Cluster in Low Range\n",
    " • The bottom-left region (low income and low CCAvg) is filled with blue dots, meaning people in this group mostly didn’t take loans.\n",
